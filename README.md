# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

## Abstract
Cruise vacation is getting more and more popular nowadays due to the pandemic situation, predicting the previous cruise accident survival would help prevent death if there is a cruise accident. Therefore, the Titanic iceberg accident is taken into the investigation. In the project, the titanic survival dataset is used to make predictions with machine learning by using the programming language, Python, to get useful insights from various attributes in the data so that the relevant cruise companies and the government from different countries would do some measure and make some regulations to help reduce the death rate in case there is an accident. It is found that there are strong relationships between by finding out the correlations among different variables. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Linear Regression are implemented for making predictions of the titanic iceberg accident survival while Decision Tree has the best accuracy with the lowest root mean squared error(0.0937).

## Introduction
Due to the recent pandemic situation, most of us are not able to travel abroad. Instead, having a cruise vacation will be a good alternative option. Therefore, we are interested in exploring the survival rate of cruise passengers if an accident occurs. And, Titanic would be a great sample for us to work on.
April 15, 1912 at 2:20 a.m.,
The 'unsinkable' Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean with nearly 1,500 killed. Titanic symbolises state-of-the-art shipping technology 1910s. Before the accident, the titanic had already travelled 1,451 miles. It was 852 feet long, displaced
52,310 tons and was equipped with systems of seal bulkheads, believed to cause
Ships not sinking. During Titanic's maiden voyage, it hit an iceberg, creating a 300-foot-long rift on its side and flooded five bulkheads. Three hours after Titanic hit the iceberg, its bulkheads were gradually cultivated with water and then sunk.
In this fatal and grave accident, plentiful people think that the chances of survival depend greatly on the class couriers of the passengers. Moreover, the other information, ranging from age to gender, from height to weight are also determining factors whether the passengers can survive in the accident.
In this project, there are three objectives. The first one would be the recognition of Titanic Survivors. The second objective would be finding out the indicative features of Titanic survivors. The third one would be figuring out the classification method of the lowest error and highest accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in the project is extracted from kaggle. It consists of 1,309 passengers information of 7 variables, including embarked, passenger class, fare, parch, number of siblings/spouses abroad Titanic, age and sex. The information is used to indicate whether the passenger can or cannot survive from the iceberg accident.
